### Tasks

**Task 1**  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, using for and while loops. 

**Task 2**  
Create an array consisting of elements of different types (primitives) (number, string, boolean variable) with a length of 10 elements. Output their type using typeof to the console. Output by iterating over the array in various ways: forEach method, loops for, while and do while. 

**Task 3**  
Create an array of objects (example object {name: '', age: xx, pets: [cat, dog]}) and use the filter method to output everyone who is over 20 years old.

**Task 4**  
Use map to iterate over the array from the task above and add a pet to each one. Print the result to the console.

**Task 5**  
Create an array of 10 elements and fill it with the number 42 using the appropriate method. Using splice, insert the word "answer" into the 5th position. Using "find", find this word and output it to the console.

**Task 6**  
Create an object with multiple keys of your choice. Give examples of using keys, hasOwn, values.
